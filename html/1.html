                    Welcome to the world of ‘Alemi. It's an old ancient world with dark and twisted forests thick with dark and twisted trees. There are plenty of friends in ‘Alemi, many of whom are loyal to Princess Raihana. But BEWARE! There are many enemies who are also loyal to the wicked witch that sits in the high castle atop the dark Negodigwadi Mountain. Negodigwadi Mountain is covered by a dark grey cloud that spins slowly around the top of the mountain. It's visible to the people of the valley only if they walk through the tenit’elit’ilwali Forest and look to the east. Other that that, the tall dark trees in east of the Werik'Ama Valley conceal the menacing and scary Negodigwadi Mountain where the wicked and evil witch named Yetere Geme lives. Yetere Geme was cast out of the city many years ago when she attempted to steal the food of the vulnerable and poor people of the Werik'Ama Valley during the many years of no rain. She was a greedy woman. Many times over she attempted to take the throne and crown from the Queen but the Queen had many loyal friends that protected her. Yetere tried everything to take control of the castle because she wanted all the power and the riches of the Werik'Ama valley all for herself. When she was cast out of the castle, to live high in the Negodigwadi Mountain, she left with a few loyal companions of evil who she promised to give her riches to and protect; these were just lies though. But her followers wouldn't see that. They believed every word she told them.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Werik'Ama Valley was bright and sunny one fine day, when Princess Raihana woke up to the sound of birds chirping and people talking in the town below her room which was high up in the top of the castle. She loved to hear the people bustling about as it gave her great comfort knowing the town was happy and active.<br>
                    <br>
                    That morning, as Princess Raihana was getting up out of bed and wiping the sleep from her eyes, she thought to herself "Today is no ordinary day!" and she was right. Today WAS no ordinary day. Although she felt excited to get the morning started by picking some fresh tomatoes for her breakfast, she just had a weird feeling...<br>
                    <br>
                    Princess Raihana walked to the powder room where she took a handful of water and splashed her face to help wake up.<br>
                    <br>
                    "Brrrr!" She said out loud.<br>
                    <br>
                    The water was as cold as ice as it splashed against her face. She rubbed around her faced, dried up, got dressed for the day and started down the stairs.<br>
